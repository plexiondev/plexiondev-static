Simple Dark is the successor to my previous dark-themed resource pack, Metro Dark Theme. This pack is built from the ground up with a sleek and modern design whilst keeping the dark aesthetic. Every GUI in the base game is themed along with most of the Realms GUIs making the experience seamless.

There is also support for a few Forge/Fabric mods now, which fit in with the Simple Dark theme. Leave any mod requests on the PMC or Github pages.
