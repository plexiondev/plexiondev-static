You are given a random target player you have to kill, if you succeed you earn points. If you kill someone who had you as their target you can also gain points, however killing anyone else will subtract points. First to 8000 will win, who will come out victorious?

Killing your target gains +150, killing your assassin gains +100, but killing random players subtracts -50.
