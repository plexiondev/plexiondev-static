This datapack allows the use of Netherite Nuggets to repair armour pieces and tools from the Advanced Netherite mod, a feature that is currently lacking.

```
/trigger heal_netherite
```

Requirements:
- Hold an eligible armour piece/tool
- 1+ Netherite Nugget in your inventory

Items are healed by **0.3%** using the new 'item_modifiers' feature in 1.17.
