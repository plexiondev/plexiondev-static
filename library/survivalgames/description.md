This is **not** a Survival Games map, this is a backend that can be used to create one. Set up your own survival games, powered by a very customisable datapack. Modify loot tables, supply drop spawns, world border locations, clone blocks and spawn locations.

The game can be started via `function sg:start`. Let the games begin!
